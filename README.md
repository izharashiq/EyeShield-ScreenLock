## 🛡️ What It Does

EyeShield uses your webcam + AI to detect when you're not looking at your screen — and **instantly** throws up a fullscreen black overlay to protect your digital secrets from prying eyes.

### ✨ Key Features

- ✅ **System-wide protection** — Works over any application
- ✅ **100% offline** — No internet required, full privacy guaranteed
- ✅ **Lightning fast** — Instant blackout when you look away
- ✅ **AI-powered** — Uses MediaPipe + OpenCV for precise detection
- ✅ **Cross-platform** — Windows, macOS, Linux compatible
- ✅ **Zero data collection** — Your privacy is sacred

## 🧠 How It Works

1. **Face Detection**: Uses MediaPipe FaceMesh to track 468 facial landmarks in real-time
2. **Gaze Analysis**: Calculates your eye direction and head orientation using advanced algorithms
3. **Privacy Trigger**: When gaze deviates from screen center → instant fullscreen overlay
4. **Smart Recovery**: Automatically removes overlay when you look back
